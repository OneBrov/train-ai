TASK: Bootstrap a minimal .NET 8 core solution with tests and CI.

Repository context:
- This repo will host a train game project. For now we only need a core simulation scaffold.
- Keep it minimal.

Requirements:
1) Create /core folder with:
   - CoreSim (class library, net8.0)
   - CoreSim.Tests (NUnit test project, net8.0)
2) CoreSim contains a placeholder class.
3) CoreSim.Tests contains a smoke test.
4) Add .github/workflows/ci.yml that runs:
   dotnet test ./core/CoreSim.Tests/CoreSim.Tests.csproj
5) Add README.md with how to run tests.
6) Do not touch main branch directly. Work via feature branch.
Output MUST be a git unified diff starting with "diff --git".
